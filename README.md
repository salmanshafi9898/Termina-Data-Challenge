IniTech operates a labor marketplace connecting workers with short-term job opportunities.
Analysis of worker-level activity and company financials indicates strong underlying unit
economics despite negative company-level profitability driven by fixed and growth-related
costs. Worker retention is strongest in the first three months and declines thereafter, while
ARPU increases meaningfully with tenure, concentrating revenue among higher-quality,
repeat workers. Retention-weighted ARPU implies lifetime gross revenue of approximately
$6,500–$8,000 per worker, supporting sustainable acquisition spend under reasonable
margin assumptions. If IniTech can improve early retention and diversify revenue sources as
it scales, the business has the potential to evolve into a more stable, compounding platform
with durable long-term economics.
